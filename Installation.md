## Fedora/Red Hat Enterprise Linux

The Copr builds RPMs for Fedora 21, 22, rawhide and RHEL 7. If you're using other RHEL-based distributions such as CentOS and Scientific Linux, you can just use the EPEL repo in Copr.

You can enable the repo via `dnf`:

```bash
sudo dnf copr enable librehat/shadowsocks
sudo dnf update
sudo dnf install shadowsocks-qt5
```

You may need to install dnf plugins by below command before you can enable copr repo.

```bash
sudo dnf install dnf-plugins-core
```

If your distribution doesn't have `dnf`, you can download the corresponding yum repo from [Copr](https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/librehat/shadowsocks/) and put it under `/etc/yum.repos.d/`, then install `shadowsocks-qt5` via `yum`:

```bash
sudo yum update
sudo yum install shadowsocks-qt5
```
