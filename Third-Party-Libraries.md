# Thrid-party libraries used in Windows prebuilt binaries

## Botan
You can download pre-compiled `botan` libraries linked in Windows builds [here] (http://file.librehat.com/botan/). Note: they're statically linked. The filename indicates build information.

## Qt
For Windows builds, self-compiled statically linked Qt libraries are used. Because they're directly compiled from Qt source without any source modifications, you can compile it yourself using Qt's source code.

## libQtShadowsocks
See my [libQtShadowsocks](https://github.com/librehat/libQtShadowsocks) project.

## zbar
Pre-compiled statically linked libraries are provided in `3rdparty` directory. You can get my modified source code [here](http://file.librehat.com/).

## qrencode
Pre-compiled statically linked libraries are provided in `3rdparty` directory. There is no source code modification. You can download the source code from their website and compile it yourself.
